Wanna go fancier? I can upgrade it to use Headless UI, transitions, or full search filter support 💡
Or a Modal? Or wrap the whole app in layout components? Let's finish this strong 💪
Responsive sidebar / top nav layout wrapper?
Export a setup as a link?
add custom spacing, shadows, or dark mode enhancements
add ssl, change ports
Animate tabs or responsive toggle for mobile?

Would you like to show total stat preview from class as well?
Would you like the selected class to also affect the StatTable?
Or maybe combine class stats and rune stats in the right panel? 💡

Let me know if you'd like to add aura handling, class stat merging into totals, or export features 📦.
✅ Here’s what I need to pick up right where we left off:
What’s next on the to-do list?
Do you want to work on a new feature (e.g., PvP build simulator, export system, or rune synergy logic)?
Or are we improving something (UI polish, bug fix, data format updates)?
Any specific file or area you want to touch?
Like maybe StatTable.jsx, the JSON parser, or something under converter/raw/.
Do you have any new data (classes, runes, etc.) to integrate?
I can help create or update flat JSON or auto-convert from game data.
Want me to connect rune stats to the compare view?
Add total stat power/score?
Let users rename runes or classes?
