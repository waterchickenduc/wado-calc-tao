If you're ready, I can now:

🔁 Patch your current SetupBuilder.jsx and CompareView.jsx to align exactly with the new Tailwind config.

✅ Clean and align layouts

🎨 Add responsiveness

⚡ Add animation



Wanna go fancier? I can upgrade it to use Headless UI, transitions, or full search filter support 💡
Or a Modal? Or wrap the whole app in layout components? Let's finish this strong 💪

Responsive sidebar / top nav layout wrapper?

Export a setup as a link?

add custom spacing, shadows, or dark mode enhancements

Show message if rune is maxed (6x)?

Add subtle click animation?

Show current number of rune stacks?

add ssl, change ports

Animate tabs or responsive toggle for mobile?

Would you like to show total stat preview from class as well?

Would you like the selected class to also affect the StatTable?
Or maybe combine class stats and rune stats in the right panel? 💡
Let me know how deep you'd like the integration to go.
