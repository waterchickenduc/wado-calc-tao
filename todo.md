If you're ready, I can now:

🔁 Patch your current SetupBuilder.jsx and CompareView.jsx to align exactly with the new Tailwind config.

✅ Clean and align layouts

🎨 Add responsiveness

⚡ Add animation



Wanna go fancier? I can upgrade it to use Headless UI, transitions, or full search filter support 💡
Or a Modal? Or wrap the whole app in layout components? Let's finish this strong 💪

Responsive sidebar / top nav layout wrapper?

Export a setup as a link?

add custom spacing, shadows, or dark mode enhancements

Show message if rune is maxed (6x)?

Add subtle click animation?

Show current number of rune stacks?

add ssl, change ports

Animate tabs or responsive toggle for mobile?

Would you like to show total stat preview from class as well?

Would you like the selected class to also affect the StatTable?
Or maybe combine class stats and rune stats in the right panel? 💡
Let me know how deep you'd like the integration to go.
UI tweaks
class validation
aura view
pot !
mercs !
💾 Save/Load builds as JSON

💡 Preview aura info

🌍 Export builds as URL

🎯 Filter by rune tags like “Othala”
Let me know if you'd like to add aura handling, class stat merging into totals, or export features 📦.





✅ Here’s what I need to pick up right where we left off:
What’s next on the to-do list?

Do you want to work on a new feature (e.g., PvP build simulator, export system, or rune synergy logic)?

Or are we improving something (UI polish, bug fix, data format updates)?

Any specific file or area you want to touch?

Like maybe StatTable.jsx, the JSON parser, or something under converter/raw/.

Do you have any new data (classes, runes, etc.) to integrate?

I can help create or update flat JSON or auto-convert from game data.
